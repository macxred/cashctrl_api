# Python Client for CashCtrl REST API

`cashctrl_api` is a lightweight Python package that streamlines interactions
with the [CashCtrl REST API](https://app.cashctrl.com/static/help/en/api/index.html).
This API serves [CashCtrl](https://cashctrl.com), a straightforward and effective
online accounting software with a clean data model and a clear REST API. Our
package acts as a thin wrapper, efficiently routing requests through universal
methods to the API without the need for implementing individual endpoints.

In `cashctrl_api`, requests are typically transmitted through generic methods:

- `get()`, `post()`, `patch()`, `put()`, and `delete()` take an API `endpoint`,
  request parameters, and a JSON payload as parameters, and return the server's
  response as a JSON dictionary.

Specialized methods manage more complex tasks:
- `file_upload()` uploads a file and marks it for persistent storage.
- `file_download()` downloads a file and saves it to the local file system.
- `list_categories()` retrieves a category tree and flattens it into a pandas
  DataFrame.
- `list_files()` lists files, their attributes, and Unix-style path
  representations of their hierarchical position in the category tree.
- `update_categories()` synchronizes a remote category tree with a given list of
  category paths, adding new categories and optionally removing those that are
  no longer needed.
- `mirror_files()` mirrors a local set of nested categories with the category
  tree on the server, mapping local sub-folders to categories on the remote
  server.

To use this Python client, you'll need a valid API key, which can be acquired
from your CashCtrl account settings -> Users & roles -> Add [API User].

## Installation

Easily install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/macxred/cashctrl_api/tarball/main
```

## Basic Usage

Get started with the CashCtrl API client by following these steps:

```python
from cashctrl_api import CashCtrlAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your organization's name and API key
cc = CashCtrlAPIClient("<my_organisation>", api_key="<my_api_key>")

# Example: Create a new contact
contact = {
    "firstName": "Tina",
    "lastName": "Test",
    "addresses": [{
            "type": "MAIN",
            "address": "Teststreet 15",
            "zip": "1234",
            "city": "Testtown"
        }],
    "titleId": 2
}
response = cc.post("person/create.json", data=contact)
id = response["insertId"]

# Retrieve the newly created contact
response = cc.get("person/read.json", params={'id': id})
print(response)

# Delete the contact
response = cc.post("person/delete.json", params={'ids': id})
print(response)
```

For simplicity, API Key and organization can also be set as environment
variables `CC_API_KEY` and `CC_API_ORGANISATION`. For example, by setting both
variables in the shell when starting python:

```bash
CC_API_ORGANISATION=<myorg> CC_API_KEY=<mykey> python
```

This allows for an even simpler code snippet:
```python
from cashctrl_api import CashCtrlAPIClient
cc = CashCtrlAPIClient()
response = cc.get("person/list.json")
```

## Testing Strategy

Tests are housed in the [tests](tests) directory and are automatically executed
via GitHub Actions after each commit, during pull requests, and on a daily
schedule. When executed as GitHub Actions, tests utilize an API key stored as a
GitHub secret, connecting to a non-public CashCtrl Test organization covered by
MaCX ReD's subscription.

We prefer pytest for its straightforward and readable syntax over the unittest
package from the standard library.


## Package Development and Contribution

### Virtual environment

We recommend using a virtual environment for package development:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/env_name
source ~/.virtualenvs/env_name/bin/activate
```

To locally modify and test the package, clone the repository and run
`python setup.py develop` in the root folder. This method adds a symbolic link
to your development directory to Python's search path, ensuring any changes are
immediately available when (re-)loading the package.

### DataFrames and Type Consistency

Accounting data is typically organized into interconnected tables, making
DataFrames exceptionally useful for data extraction, manipulation, and
in-memory storage. For example, ledger entries can be efficiently retrieved
and converted to a DataFrame, then further queried as follows:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(cc_client.get('journal/list.json'))
df.loc[df['account'] == '1020', 'amount'].sum()
```

A DataFrame is essentially a named collection of vectors of the same length,
where each vector has its own data type, and the names are treated as column
headers. While R's tibbles provide a straightforward implementation of this
concept, pandas DataFrames introduce complexities with their multi-dimensional
indexing. In our experience, this limited additional functionality does not
justify the added complexity. Therefore, in this package, we minimize the use
of DataFrame indexing and consistently use strings for column indices to
maintain simplicity and clarity.

DataFrames are dynamic, allowing for the addition and removal of columns and
the modification of column types. While this flexibility is powerful for
explorations in an interpreted environment (as shown in the ledger example
above), it can pose challenges in production code. For instance, if the API
returns an empty list, the 'df' in above example will be empty with no columns,
causing an exception when attempting to access the non-existent `df['account']`
column.

To ensure robustness in such cases, we provide the `enforce_column_types()`
function to maintain consistency of expected columns and their data types. This
function ensures that your code functions correctly, regardless of the data
returned by the API:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(cc_client.get('journal/list.json'))
columns = {'date': 'datetime64', 'amount': 'float', 'account': 'str'}
df = enforce_column_types(df, mandatory_columns=columns)
df.loc[df['account'] == '1020', 'amount'].sum()
```

### Leveraging AI Tools

ChatGPT has been extremely helpful in the development of this package,
particularly for developers less seasoned in Python package development. It
assists with various development tasks, from generating quick code snippets to
implementing pseudocode and conducting full code reviews. Python's nature as an
interpreted language integrates well with ChatGPTâ€™s capabilities, allowing it to
process data structures from console outputs and suggest actionable code
snippets. This enables immediate testing and iterative refinement. ChatGPT also
excels in more complex tasks such as writing docstrings, crafting unit tests,
performing code reviews, and ensuring compliance with Python standards and best
practices.

The modular structure of open-source Python packages aligns well with ChatGPT's
abilities, making it especially effective for projects with clear package
structures and concise code segments. Trained with numerous open-source
Python projects, it adeptly adjusts to different coding styles and bridges
community preferences (e.g., unittest vs. pytest). Python's approach to in-code
documentation also enables ChatGPT to understand both the scope and the
implementation details of code segments.

While ChatGPT is highly effective and knowledgeable, it has its limitations. It
lacks creativity and experience, and its output can be bloated. It
does not provide perfect outcomes right out of the box but requires precise
instructions. Much like a conductor leading an orchestra, you must guide ChatGPT
by gradually steering it towards the desired results.

Here are a few suggestions for useful prompts:

```
Review this Python unit and the corresponding test suite. [upload files]
Provide review as downloadable markdown file with 79 char line width.
Implement the first and third suggestions from your review.
Suggest alternative wordings for foo().
Provide a one-line module docstring.
Provide a docstring for foo, keep it concise.
Align code with the style of popular open-source Python packages.
Format this API response [paste console output].
```

For those who find ChatGPT beneficial, we recommend considering a paid license
to access its richer language model and advanced features.

We have primarily used ChatGPT, and our experience with other AI tools like
GitHub Copilot is limited. We are eager to learn from the community about these
tools to better understand what works best. Your feedback is highly valued. We
encourage users to share their experiences, helping us all to learn and benefit
from collective knowledge. We remain committed to open-source principles, not
only to share our work but also to foster a community of shared learning and
improvement.
