Manual testing required:

  - initially the file should be empty after the "==..." line
  - (manually) upload the file to the server
  - then write something after the "==..." line
  - now save (and the local mtime is supposed to be after the server mtime of the file)
  - call the 'file_update' function and check 'cctest_update.txt' on the server
